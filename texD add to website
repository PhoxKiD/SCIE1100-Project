Welcome to Kryptos!

The purpose of this website is to teach anyone the basics of cryptology, and show examples of early applications of cryptology, including the Caesar cipher and the Vinginere cipher.

Encryption is a modern application of cryptology. Modern encryption works by altering some data with a key so it becomes jumbled and unreadable. The same key can be used to decrypt the data, making it readable again. Some of the modern applications of encryption include encrypting Internet connections and files.
